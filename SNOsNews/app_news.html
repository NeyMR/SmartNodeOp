        <div class="tab-content" data-tab-content="updates">		
			<h2>Version 1.0.7.0 Feature Highlights:</h2>

			<h3>Pi Consensus Container Metrics Updates:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Docker Volume and Available Space Visualization: This enables a visual representation of Node Disk Usage.</li>
				<li>Log Size Adjustments: Logs now retain valuable time-framed information while striving to minimize application memory usage. This is an ongoing process to keep the tool lightweight and with minimal impact on system performance during monitoring.</li>
				<li>Reduced Frequency of CPU and Memory Usage Metrics: These metrics now update every 60 seconds (equivalent to 10 minutes for a full frame).</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>SmartNodeOps Fixes:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Addition of Memory Manager and DataManager: These enhancements improve performance for long-run monitoring. It's recommended to run monitoring for shorter periods while we continue to fine-tune these features. Currently, a 6-hour run uses around 500-600MB of memory, but we're aiming for even lower memory usage for longer monitoring sessions.</li>
				<li>Performance Updates: More performance optimizations have been implemented in the codebase.</li>
			</ul>
